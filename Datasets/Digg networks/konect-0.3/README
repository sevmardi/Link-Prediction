What is it?
===========

This collection of network extraction tools is part of the KONECT
project: http://konect.uni-koblenz.de

In each subdirectory you can find code to extract one group of datasets,
usually from one source, and generate a TSV file from it.

If you are looking for the code for a specific network, you can find
the name of the subirectory in the field "extr" of the metafile,
which comes with the TSV files you can download from our network pages.

Please note, that not every network has the extraction code publically
available.

The extraction code is written for POSIX environments (i.e., Linux, Unix, etc.).
It consists of a makefile, which calls appropriate shell/awk/perl scripts.

Latest Version
==============

You can find the latest version of this tarball on the following page:

http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/downloads/

Usage
=====

To build the datasets, execute "make" or "stu" inside the directory.
The code downloads the datasets from their online sources and converts
them to the KONECT format. 


Dependencies
============

You may need to install the following additional software packages:
    - unzip
    - aria2
    - tofrodos (providing fromdos/todos)


License
=======

The extraction code is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
which you can find provided in the file COPYING.

Internals
=========

Most datasets are downloaded automatically from the Web. 

Some datasets require own/ to be present in this directory.  The
directory own/ must link to, mount, or contain the konect/own/
directory from the KONECT file server.   

Stu
===

We're converting the directories to Stu.  

Stu targets:

default target:  generate all data.

@deploy:  copy over to konect/.  These copy the relevant files into
konect/dat/, but usually don't create the symlinks in uni/.

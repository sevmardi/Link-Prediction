long-description: This is the directed network of "@username" mentions on Twitter. Each node is a Twitter user, and each directed edge from user A to user B means that user A has mentioned user B in a tweet using the "@username" syntax. Multiple edges are allowed, and each edge is annotated with the timestamp of the tweet. Since it is possible to mention one's own username, this network contains loops.

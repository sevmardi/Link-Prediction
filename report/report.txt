Datasets (1 page)

Which data sets are you going to use?
Why is this data good for these experiments?
Is the data possible biased and how does this affect the experiments?

Almost all link prediction works need to verify their methods on the collected datasets. The datasets are important for fairly reproducing and comparing different link prediction methods. Constructing and collecting the datasets is a time-consuming and labor-intensive work. That said, not all the datasets are publicly available to use and some of the sets are either incomplete or missing values. As mentioned in the sub-section Constructing Data Sets the dataset needs splitting into training sets and testing sets and to link-predict correctly our focus lies specifically on datasets with timestamps attached to each set of points this way we can easily check if a set exists in training set and test set given the dates of, for instances two authors previously worked together and might work together in the near future. 
During scouting on the web for datasets we came across several useful datasets to which we think we can work with and produce some results with it. In the table below we summarize 5 datasets we used for link prediction. As you might notice, most of the sets are coming from konect such as the UC Irvine messages which is an directed network contains sent messages between the users of an online community of students from the University of California.
